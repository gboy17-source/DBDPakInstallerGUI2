# Gboy's DBD Pak Installer 
Unfortunately, something unforeseen happened to my pc and I lost the original version in my local drive so I uploaded the updated one in a new Repository.
# This is a new and improved Pak installer with added Pak bypass. 

Hi, I'm a noob programmer and this is my first program release please be gentle

# IMPORTANT

Make sure you have a click the Pak bypass button before you install mods otherwise it won't work. You can download mods here https://www.nirvanacheats.com/ just go to 'Mods' to find the mods you like. Also turn off you're antivirus if it doesn't work as it's probably being flagged as malicious but it's just false positives # TURN OFF ANTI-VIRUS
